# Next.js/Drie <Html> error

This repo is meant as a demo to showcase an error when combining Next.js routing (both `router.push()` and `<Link>`) with Drei's `<Html>` tag.

This project only showcases the `router.push()` as the `<Link>` already gives an error when the page is loaded and the `router.push()` only once the element is actually clicked.

### To test

- Clone the repo
- (If available) `nvm use` (and if you haven't installed it `nvm install 12`)
- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`
- Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
